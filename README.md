Hello there! I'm Pedro, from Blumenau, Brazil.
This is my page and currently studying more about C#
I've already studied about C, C++, a little bit of Java, all of them in UFSC (Santa Catarina federal university)
Today i'm searching for a new job, somewhere i can do both, study and work.
You can find me on my email pedroevers@gmail.com, my linkedin www.linkedin.com/in/pedro-henrique-evers-903a3ab3 and my ig @ph.evers
Any questions, please, send me a message.
